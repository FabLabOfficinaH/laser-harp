This project consists in the creation of a musical instrument, in this particular case a laser harp with small and cheap lasers, Arduino as control and a sound generator to simulate the exact instrument. There are some critical points, which have been solved with the invention of a dedicated management firmware: playing with only 8 chords can create some problems for example with the management of the octaves.
